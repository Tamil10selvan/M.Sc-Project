ENCRYPTION IN CRYPTOGRAPHY -
With advancement in technology it becomes more easier to en-
crypt data, with neural networks it becomes easier to keep data safe.
Neural networks of Google Brain have worked out to create encryp-
tion, without teaching specics of encryption algorithm. Data Scien-
tist and cryptographers are nding out ways to prevent brute force
attack on encryption algorithms to avoid any unauthorized access to
sensitive data.
Data protection is a function of encryption, and algorithm refers
to a set of guidelines or remarks that must be followed to through-
out the encryption process. The encryption functions, procedures,
and keys utilised all contribute to the system's eectiveness. Using
a public or private key, the recipient may transform the coded text
or unreadable format back to plain text.
